# ArcadeGame
 RMIT project 3 - Arcade game

## Quickstart
- Download the project and decompress into a directory
- Locate `index.html` and open it with your favourite internet browser

**Game function:**
- Select a character at the start of the game
- Click on the on Start button to initiate the game play
- Use the keyboard arrow up/down/left/right keys to navigate your character
- The intention of the game is to get your character across to the river (blue tiles)
- If you strike the bugs your character will be reset and placed back at the start point and you will lose a point (if you had any)
- The bugs speed is randomised, so you will need to be quick and strategic to get across to the river!

**Dependencies:**
- I have referenced external CSS files used for the arcade game style fonts.

**Future implementation/Nice to have***
- Apply the lives rating based on player performance
